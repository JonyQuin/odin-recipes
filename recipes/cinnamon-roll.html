    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>Cinnamon rolls are a beloved sweet pastry known for their soft, fluffy texture and rich, gooey cinnamon-sugar filling. Originating from Europe, they've become a popular treat around the world, especially in North America. Typically enjoyed as a breakfast item or dessert, cinnamon rolls are made from a yeasted dough that's rolled out, spread with a buttery cinnamon-sugar mixture, then rolled up and sliced into individual portions before being baked. The final touch is often a drizzle or thick layer of sweet icing or glaze, adding an extra layer of sweetness to this already indulgent treat.</p>
    <h4>The Recipe</h4>
    <p><strong>Dough</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (240ml) warm milk (about 110째F or 45째C)</li>
        <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>4 cups (500g) all-purpose flour, more for dusting</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
        <li>1 cup (200g) brown sugar, packed</li>
        <li>2 and 1/2 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <p><strong>Frosting</strong></p>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>2 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 to 2 tablespoons milk</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm milk. Add sugar, butter, salt, eggs, and flour; mix well. Knead the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with flour. Put it in a bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Make the Filling:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Mix brown sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Assemble the Rolls:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>After the dough has doubled in size, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and roll the dough into a 16x21-inch rectangle. Spread the dough with 1/3 cup butter and sprinkle evenly with the sugar/cinnamon mixture.</li>
            <li>Starting with the longer side, roll the dough tightly and cut into 12 rolls. Place rolls in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking pan. Cover and let rise until nearly doubled, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C). Bake cinnamon rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Frosting:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>While rolls are baking, beat together cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and enough milk to achieve a drizzle-able consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>Final Touch:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Once rolls are finished baking, spread frosting on warm rolls before serving.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
