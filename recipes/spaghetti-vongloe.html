    <h3>Descriprion</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti Vongole is a classic Italian dish that brings the flavors of the sea to your plate with its simple yet aromatic ingredients. This pasta dish is made with clams, which are known as "vongole" in Italian, garlic, red pepper flakes, and parsley, all tossed with spaghetti in a light sauce made from the clams' juices, olive oil, and a splash of white wine. It's a perfect example of the Italian culinary principle of using high-quality, fresh ingredients to create a dish that's both flavorful and straightforward. Ideal for a quick weeknight dinner or a special occasion, Spaghetti Vongole embodies the essence of Mediterranean cuisine, offering a balance of savory, briny, and herbaceous notes.</p>
    <h3>The recipe</h3>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 kg (2.2 lbs) fresh clams, scrubbed clean</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 small bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1-2 dried red chilies, crumbled (or 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes)</li>
        <li>150ml (5 fl oz) dry white wine</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 lemon, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Pasta:</strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside, reserving a cup of the pasta water.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Clams: </strong>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large pan over medium heat. Add a generous glug of olive oil and the sliced garlic. Saut√© until the garlic is fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Add the crumbled chili or red pepper flakes and stir.</li>
        <li><strong>Deglaze with Wine:</strong>Increase the heat to medium-high, add the clams to the pan, and pour in the white wine. Cover the pan with a lid and let the clams steam open for about 5-7 minutes. Shake the pan occasionally. Once the clams have opened, remove them with a slotted spoon and set aside, discarding any that remain closed.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Pasta and Clams: </strong> Add the cooked spaghetti to the pan with the clam juice, tossing well to coat the pasta. If the sauce seems too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water to loosen it.</li>
        <li><strong>Final Touches:</strong>Return the clams to the pan, add half of the chopped parsley, and toss everything together over low heat for a minute or so, until the spaghetti is fully coated in the sauce and heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve: </strong>Divide the spaghetti and clams among bowls, sprinkle with the remaining parsley, and drizzle with a little more olive oil. Serve with lemon wedges on the side for those who like a citrusy zing.</li>
