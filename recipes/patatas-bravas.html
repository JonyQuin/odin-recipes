    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Patatas bravas, or "fierce potatoes," is a classic Spanish tapas dish known for its bold, spicy sauce. This simple yet delicious dish consists of white potatoes cut into irregular cubes, fried in oil, and served with a spicy tomato sauce and sometimes aioli. The result is a perfect balance of crispy, tender potatoes with a flavorful kick. </p>
    <h3>The recipe</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <p><strong>For the potatoes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large white potatoes, peeled and cut into 2-3 cm cubes</li>
        <li>Olive oil for frying</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>For the bravas sauce:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust according to taste)</li>
        <li>1 can (400g) of crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Optional for serving:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
        <li>Aioli</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Potatoes:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse the cubed potatoes under cold water to remove any excess starch. Pat them dry with a towel.</li>
            <li>Heat a generous amount of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan. Fry until they're golden and crispy on all sides. This should take about 10-15 minutes per batch.</li>
            <li>Once fried, transfer the potatoes to a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Sprinkle with a little salt while they're still warm.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Make the Bravas Sauce:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until it's soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper to the onions. Cook for another minute, stirring constantly, until the spices are fragrant.</li>
            <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes and red wine vinegar. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then lower the heat and let it cook for about 20 minutes. The sauce should thicken slightly.</li>
            <li>Once the sauce has thickened, taste and season with salt and pepper as needed. For a smoother sauce, you can blend it with an immersion blender or in a stand blender until it reaches your desired consistency.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Serve:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>To serve, place the fried potatoes on a serving plate. Pour the bravas sauce over the potatoes, or serve it on the side for dipping.</li>
            <li>If using, drizzle with aioli and garnish with chopped parsley.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately while the potatoes are still warm.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
