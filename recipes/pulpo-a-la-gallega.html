    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pulpo a la Gallega, also known as "Pulpo á Feira" in Galicia, is a quintessential dish from the Galician region of Spain, renowned for its simplicity and rich flavors. This delicacy features tender octopus slices seasoned with coarse sea salt, pimentón (Spanish paprika), and a drizzle of olive oil. It's traditionally served on wooden planks or plates, accompanied by boiled potatoes, enhancing the dish's rustic charm. The key to its signature taste lies in the cooking of the octopus, which is boiled to perfection to achieve a tender yet firm texture. Pulpo a la Gallega is a staple at local festivals and gatherings, embodying the essence of Galician cuisine.</p>
    <h3>The recipe</h3>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large octopus (about 2-3 pounds)</li>
        <li>Coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>Spanish paprika (pimentón), sweet or spicy according to taste</li>
        <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>4-5 medium potatoes (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Octopus:</strong> If your octopus is not pre-cleaned, clean it by removing the beak and ink sac. Freeze the octopus for at least 24 hours before cooking to help tenderize the meat. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight before cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Boil the Octopus:</strong>Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil. Before placing the octopus in the boiling water, hold it by the head and dip it in and out of the water three times. This process, known as "scaring the octopus," helps to firm up the skin. After the third dip, submerge the octopus completely and reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cook for about 45 minutes to an hour, or until the octopus is tender. You can test for doneness by piercing the thickest part of a tentacle with a fork.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the Potatoes (Optional): </strong>While the octopus is cooking, boil the potatoes in a separate pot until they are tender. Slice them into rounds and set aside.</li>
        <li><strong>Slice the Octopus: </strong>Once the octopus is cooked and has cooled slightly, cut the tentacles into bite-sized slices using kitchen scissors or a sharp knife.</li>
    </ol>
