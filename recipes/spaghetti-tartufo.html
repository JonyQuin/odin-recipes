    <h3>The recipe</h3>
    <p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>100g (3.5 oz) fresh truffles (black or white, according to taste and availability), thinly sliced or grated</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, grated (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the Spaghetti: </strong>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente. Reserve a cup of pasta water and then drain the spaghetti. </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Truffle Sauce:</strong>While the pasta cooks, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for 1-2 minutes until fragrant but not browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Spaghetti and Truffles: </strong>dd the cooked spaghetti to the skillet with the garlic. If using grated truffles, add them now, reserving some for garnish. Toss everything together well, adding a little pasta water if needed to create a light sauce that coats the spaghetti. If using sliced truffles, add them at this stage so they warm but retain their texture. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.</li>
        <li><strong>Finish and Serve:</strong>Transfer the spaghetti to serving dishes. Garnish with additional truffle slices, grated Parmesan cheese (if using), and chopped parsley. Serve immediately to enjoy the full aroma and flavor of the truffles.</li>
